The first argument pass to bind then allows you to set the this keyword in the to-be-executed function, which does not matter to us here. Hence, we can set this to null. But the second argument you pass to bind will then be the first argument received by that to-be-called function. Any other arguments which might be passed by the place where the function is then actually being called which happens in useHttp, will then simply be appended to the end of the parameter list.
